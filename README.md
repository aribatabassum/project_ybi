This is my project on Hospital Patient Risk Analysis.

In this project, I used data to better understand hospital patient records and group them based on factors like age, BMI, and blood pressure.
With a method I learnt in this internship called KMeans clustering, I was able to divide patients into different risk levels. Using Matplotlib library i was able to create data visualization patterns/charts.
THANK YOU.
